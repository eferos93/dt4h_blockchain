#   This is a configuration file for the fabric-ca-server command.
#
#   COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#   ------------------------------------------------
#   Each configuration element can be overridden via command line
#   arguments or environment variables.  The precedence for determining
#   the value of each element is as follows:
#   1) command line argument
#      Examples:
#      a) --port 443
#         To set the listening port
#      b) --ca.keyfile ../mykey.pem
#         To set the "keyfile" element in the "ca" section below;
#         note the '.' separator character.
#   2) environment variable
#      Examples:
#      a) FABRIC_CA_SERVER_PORT=443
#         To set the listening port
#      b) FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE="../mykey.pem"
#         To set the "keyfile" element in the "ca" section below;
#         note the '_' separator character.
#   3) configuration file
#   4) default value (if there is one)
#      All default values are shown beside each element below.
#
#   FILE NAME ELEMENTS
#   ------------------
#   The value of all fields whose name ends with "file" or "files" are
#   name or names of other files.
#   For example, see "tls.certfile" and "tls.clientauth.certfiles".
#   The value of each of these fields can be a simple filename, a
#   relative path, or an absolute path.  If the value is not an
#   absolute path, it is interpretted as being relative to the location
#   of this configuration file.

#  TLS section for the server's listening port
#
#  The following types are supported for client authentication: NoClientCert,
#  RequestClientCert, RequireAnyClientCert, VerifyClientCertIfGiven,
#  and RequireAndVerifyClientCert.
#
#  Certfiles is a list of root certificate authorities that the server uses
#  when verifying client certificates.

#  The CA section contains information related to the Certificate Authority
#  including the name of the CA, which should be unique for all members
#  of a blockchain network.  It also includes the key and certificate files
#  used when issuing enrollment certificates (ECerts) and transaction
#  certificates (TCerts).
#  The chainfile (if it exists) contains the certificate chain which
#  should be trusted for this CA, where the 1st in the chain is always the
#  root CA certificate.

#  The gencrl REST endpoint is used to generate a CRL that contains revoked
#  certificates. This section contains configuration options that are used
#  during gencrl request processing.
#############################################################################
crl:
  # Specifies expiration for the generated CRL. The number of hours
  # specified by this property is added to the UTC time, the resulting time
  # is used to set the 'Next Update' date of the CRL.
  expiry: 24h

#############################################################################
#  The registry section controls how the fabric-ca-server does two things:
#  1) authenticates enrollment requests which contain a username and password
#     (also known as an enrollment ID and secret).
#  2) once authenticated, retrieves the identity's attribute names and
#     values which the fabric-ca-server optionally puts into TCerts
#     which it issues for transacting on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
#     These attributes are useful for making access control decisions in
#     chaincode.
#  There are two main configuration options:
#  1) The fabric-ca-server is the registry.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is false.
#  2) An LDAP server is the registry, in which case the fabric-ca-server
#     calls the LDAP server to perform these tasks.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is true,
#     which means this "registry" section is ignored.
#############################################################################

  # Maximum number of times a password/secret can be reused for enrollment
  # (default: -1, which means there is no limit)
  maxenrollments: -1

# Affiliations section. Fabric CA server can be bootstrapped with the
# affiliations specified in this section. Affiliations are specified as maps.
# For example:
#   businessunit1:
#     department1:
#       - team1
#   businessunit2:
#     - department2
#     - department3
#
# Affiliations are hierarchical in nature. In the above example,
# department1 (used as businessunit1.department1) is the child of businessunit1.
# team1 (used as businessunit1.department1.team1) is the child of department1.
# department2 (used as businessunit2.department2) and department3 (businessunit2.department3)
# are children of businessunit2.
# Note: Affiliations are case sensitive except for the non-leaf affiliations
# (like businessunit1, department1, businessunit2) that are specified in the configuration file,
# which are always stored in lower case.

#  Signing section
#
#  The "default" subsection is used to sign enrollment certificates;
#  the default expiration ("expiry" field) is "8760h", which is 1 year in hours.
#
#  The "ca" profile subsection is used to sign intermediate CA certificates;
#  the default expiration ("expiry" field) is "43800h" which is 5 years in hours.
#  Note that "isca" is true, meaning that it issues a CA certificate.
#  A maxpathlen of 0 means that the intermediate CA cannot issue other
#  intermediate CA certificates, though it can still issue end entity certificates.
#  (See RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.9)
#
#  The "tls" profile subsection is used to sign TLS certificate requests;
#  the default expiration ("expiry" field) is "8760h", which is 1 year in hours.

#  Certificate Signing Request (CSR) section.
#  This controls the creation of the root CA certificate.
#  The expiration for the root CA certificate is configured with the
#  "ca.expiry" field below, whose default value is "131400h" which is
#  15 years in hours.
#  The pathlength field is used to limit CA certificate hierarchy as described
#  in section 4.2.1.9 of RFC 5280.
#  Examples:
#  1) No pathlength value means no limit is requested.
#  2) pathlength == 1 means a limit of 1 is requested which is the default for
#     a root CA.  This means the root CA can issue intermediate CA certificates,
#     but these intermediate CAs may not in turn issue other CA certificates
#     though they can still issue end entity certificates.
#  3) pathlength == 0 means a limit of 0 is requested;
#     this is the default for an intermediate CA, which means it can not issue
#     CA certificates though it can still issue end entity certificates.
